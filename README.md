# ferretCodingCompanion
This **2D RPG mobile game** is about a player who accompanies their **ferret (favorite!) coding companion Loki**, a young, mischievous ferret on his first adventure exploring the unknown region of a village. In his journey, he'll be welcomed by a friendly group of animal villagers who will help him understand where he is with the help of the player through a series of different logic-based questions (if/else, boolean, for and while loops) that kids are able to answer and learn from. With every question answered correctly, the player can earn coins as their reward and spend them in order to unlock new parts of the village, gain new animal friends, quests, and more! 

Programmed the **front-end user interface** by integrating the **dialogue/questing system, tile mapping, and player movement/animations** by using **Unity** as the game engine and coding the scripts in **C#**. Created initial design on [Figma](https://figma.fun/hXPzgq) and used free assets from itch.io. If you want to view the current progress made, check out the **demo video** below!

# ferretCodingCompanion
A mobile game that teaches kids basic coding logic (if/else, boolean, for and while loops) by completing fun minigames and quests! 

**Built using C#, Unity, and Figma [https://figma.fun/hXPzgq]**

The game is about a player who accompanies their ferret (favorite!) coding companion Loki, a young, mischievous ferret on his first adventure exploring the unknown region of a village. In his journey, he'll be welcomed by a friendly group of animal villagers who will help him understand where he is with the help of the player through a series of different logic-based questions that kids are able to answer and learn from. With every question answered correctly, the player can earn coins as their reward and spend them in order to unlock new parts of the village, gain new animal friends, quests, and more!
